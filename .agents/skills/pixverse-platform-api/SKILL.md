# PixVerse Platform API

Use this skill for the server-side Platform API through `pixverse-api platform`. It is separate from the web `pixverse` CLI and from `pixverse-api growth-studio`; credentials, credits, commands, and job artifacts do not cross those boundaries.

## Route the request

- Read [capabilities](references/capabilities.md) to select an operation or build a prerequisite chain from a user goal.
- Read [operation catalog](references/operation-catalog.md) for the exact command, method, path, billing class, async behavior, result ID, and official endpoint page.
- Read [payload examples](references/payload-examples.json) before authoring a payload or query.

## Provider boundary

Use only `PIXVERSE_PLATFORM_API_KEY` and the default `https://app-api.pixverse.ai`. Never use Growth Studio keys, web-session credentials, or another provider's credit balance. Preserve all API IDs as strings.

## Safe execution

1. Resolve prerequisites with read-only catalog/account calls.
2. Validate a specialized command locally and run it with `--dry-run`.
3. For a billable operation, confirm the exact live spend is authorized in the active request immediately before submission.
4. Submit once with a fresh trace ID, preferably through `run-job`; preserve the returned job directory and result ID.
5. Poll the known image/video ID or use `resume`. If submission was ambiguous and no ID was saved, stop at `reconciliation_required`; do not resubmit.
6. Treat success as transport success plus `ErrCode === 0`.

Use `platform raw` only for diagnosis or a newly documented endpoint absent from the specialized catalog. Do not use raw access to bypass specialized validation, authentication, trace, billing, or recovery controls.
